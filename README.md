# hu-gpr
A collection of helpful Mathematica (11.3) bits for the GPR at my local university

HUPP is made almost entirely by Julien Kluge, see http://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~julien/
We talked sometime in the past about it, and I did only add a dozen(!) letters to his file, in order to migrate to Mathematica 11.3.
